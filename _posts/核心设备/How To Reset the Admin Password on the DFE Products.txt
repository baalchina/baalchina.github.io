Symptoms   
Lost password    
Forgot password

Cause   
If the admin password is lost or forgotten, then the only way to create, edit or delete user accounts on the DFE products is to reset it back to its default value.

Solution   
To reset the admin password:

Pull all of the blades from the backplane.    
Using anti-static precautions, select one of the blades and toggle switch 8 on its dip switch bank. If you cannot locate the dip switch bank, consult the Installation Guide for your specific blade model.     
Reinsert it into the chassis, and allow it to fully boot. This blade will become the Management Master switch for the system, with the passwords initialized to their defaults.     
At any time thereafter, reinsert the other blades into the chassis.    
It is not possible to reset the rw or ro passwords by external means. Recover the admin password and then administer the other passwords as desired.
